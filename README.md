# Awesome-CV-colorizer
Just some scripts to edit [Awesome-CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) and compile locally

## Needs

* Texlive
* font-awesome (sudo apt-get install fonts-font-awesome)

## Future

* Edit more of the underlying Tex to do additional cololors
* Python CLI to take inputs of certain colors (e.g. for applying to specific company color scheme)
